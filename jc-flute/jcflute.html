        <h1> Why Warm Ups?</h1>
        <p>I have been using written out warm up booklets for my pupils for over twenty years now and my colleagues were forever telling me I need to get them into print and share them. The lockdown in 2020 gave me the time and space to do so and their success has left me humbled and grateful.</p>
        <h2>TO TEACHERS:</h2>
        <p>In my many years of teaching and inheriting pupils from other teachers, one of my first questions to an existing learner has always been, 'What would you normally play to warm up?' I am heartened when I hear their response to be 'long notes' but, in my experience, asking a pupil to practise long notes often produces a random selection of long tones played without any thought to the technique or production of that said long note and my sceptical mind doubts if this is a regular part of the said pupil's practice routine! If you expand upon the long note exercises and make them hard enough that they require practice between lessons to be able to play them, then you will hear immediately whether your pupil has practised their tone work from week to week, and their developing tonal control and dexterity within their sound will improve as a result, over time.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>I have written these series of books to cover learners from their first three notes through to diploma level; ensuring their foundations are set from the outset with consistent and thorough guidance alongside the general syllabus requirements of the major examination boards, with clear and accessible guidance for each exercise.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I have, in general, not stipulated metronome speeds, dynamics or breathing within the exercises so that you can add your own, according to your student's learning requirements</p>
        <h2>TO PUPILS:</h2>
        <p>Warm ups are the most important part of your practice. If you don't have a beautiful sound, it doesn't matter how fast you can play or how musically you interpret your pieces, they will not sound great.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Your tone is your voice and if your sound is weak, it won't travel beyond your music stand and no-one will be able to hear you; and if your sound isn't good, why would anyone want to? Take ownership of your sound and use your warm ups to find your own unique and beautiful voice so that you can tell your tonal story through your music and charm everyone that hears you!</p>
        <br>
        <p>Everyone's sound is special to them and depends on various things: the shape of your lips, your teeth, the cavity within your mouth, your technique, your breathing, your diaphragm engagement, your airspeed, and your determination to be the best you can be. Do as your teacher instructs in terms of correct breathing, embouchure and posture; do your warm ups at the start of each and every practice that you do, practice your scales and become the best flute player you could possibly be!</p>

Each exercise headed with directions, which may have previously been ignored, pupils realise that they may actually be important and take notice!
